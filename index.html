			<H3> Hі! </H3>
			<p> My name is Anya, and I am 17 years old. </p>
        	<p> I live in Dnipro, a city in the central region of Ukraine. My city is considered 
			the capital of the Ukraine rocket and space industry.</p>
			<p> I studied in a class with advanced mathematics and physics at multidisciplinary 
			school №23. But in 2023, this educational institution received the title lyceum, 
			so I graduated from the “multilingual” lyceum №23 (why?!). </p>
			<P> In August 2024, I entered the best university in the Dnipropetrovsk region and 
			the entire central region of Ukraine! </P>
			<P> When I was in school, I liked programming. Based on the fact that I have an 
			analytical mind and I like mathematics, I chose the System Analysis curriculum. 
			Now I am studying in the PS-24-1 group with	no less wonderful and entertaining people. </P>
			<P> It was nice to meet you! </P>
